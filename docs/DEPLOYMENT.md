# Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying the GenAIID AgentCore Starter Pack (GASP) to AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 20+** installed (see [AWS guide for installing Node.js on EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html))
- **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate permissions
- **AWS CDK CLI** installed: `npm install -g aws-cdk` (see [CDK Getting Started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting-started.html))
- **Python 3** A recent version of Python is required (3.12+ suggested).
- **Docker** installed. (see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create:
  - S3 buckets
  - CloudFront distributions
  - Cognito User Pools
  - ECR repositories
  - CodeBuild projects
  - Amplify Hosting projects
  - Bedrock AgentCore resources
  - IAM roles and policies

### Docker Cross-Platform Build Setup (Required for non-ARM machines)

**Important**: BedrockAgentCore Runtime only supports ARM64 architecture. If you're deploying from a non-ARM machine (x86_64/amd64), you need to enable Docker's cross-platform building capabilities.

Check your machine architecture:
```bash
uname -m
```

If the output is `x86_64` (not `aarch64` or `arm64`), run these commands:

1. **Enable Docker buildx and create a multi-platform builder:**
   ```bash
   docker buildx create --use --name multiarch --driver docker-container
   docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
   ```

2. **Install QEMU for ARM64 emulation:**
   ```bash
   docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
   ```

3. **Verify ARM64 support is available:**
   ```bash
   docker buildx ls
   ```
   You should see `linux/arm64` in the platforms list.

**Note**: This setup is only required once per machine. The CDK deployment will automatically use these capabilities to build ARM64 containers.

## Configuration

### 1. Update Configuration File

Edit `infra-cdk/config.yaml` to customize your deployment:

```yaml
stack_name_base: your-project-name # Change this to your preferred stack name

admin_user_email: null # Optional: admin@example.com (auto-creates user & emails credentials)

frontend:
  domain_name: null # Optional: Set to your custom domain (e.g., "app.example.com")
  certificate_arn: null # Optional: Set to your ACM certificate ARN if using custom domain

backend:
  pattern: strands-single-agent # Available patterns: strands-single-agent
```

**Important**: Change `stack_name_base` to a unique name for your project to avoid conflicts.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install infrastructure dependencies:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
npm install
cd ..
```

**Note**: Frontend dependencies are automatically installed during deployment via Docker bundling,
so no separate frontend `npm install` is required.

### 2. Bootstrap CDK (First Time Only)

If this is your first time using CDK in this AWS account/region:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
npm cdk bootstrap
```

### 3. Deploy backend with CDK

Build and deploy the complete stack:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
npx cdk deploy
```

The deployment will:

1. Create a Cognito User Pool for authentication
1. Build and push the agent container to ECR
1. Create the AgentCore runtime
1. Set up CloudFront distribution for the frontend

**Note**: The deployment takes approximately 5-10 minutes due to container building and AgentCore setup.

### 4. Deploy frontend

```bash
# From root directory
./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
```

This script automatically:

- Generates fresh `aws-exports.json` from CDK stack outputs
- Installs/updates npm dependencies if needed
- Builds the Next.js frontend
- Deploys to AWS Amplify Hosting

You will see the URL for application in the script's output, which will look similar to this:

```
ℹ App URL: https://main.d123abc456def7.amplifyapp.com
```

#### Understanding aws-exports.json

The `aws-exports.json` file is a critical configuration file that enables the React frontend to communicate with AWS Cognito for authentication. This file is automatically generated during frontend deployment and contains the necessary configuration parameters for Cognito authentication.

**What is aws-exports.json?**

The `aws-exports.json` file contains authentication configuration that the React application reads to properly configure Cognito Authentication. It's created automatically by the deployment script and placed in `frontend/public/aws-exports.json`.

**Why is it necessary?**

This configuration file is essential because:

- It provides the React application with the correct Cognito User Pool and Client IDs
- It specifies the authentication endpoints and redirect URIs
- It configures the authentication flow parameters
- Without this file, Cognito authentication will not work

**How is it created?**

The file is automatically generated by the `post-deploy.py` script (called by `deploy-frontend.sh`) which:

1. Extracts configuration from your deployed CDK stack outputs
2. Automatically detects the AWS region from the CloudFormation stack ARN
3. Retrieves the required values: `CognitoClientId`, `CognitoUserPoolId`, and `AmplifyUrl`
4. Generates the configuration file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "authority": "https://cognito-idp.region.amazonaws.com/user-pool-id",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "redirect_uri": "https://your-amplify-url",
  "post_logout_redirect_uri": "https://your-amplify-url",
  "response_type": "code",
  "scope": "email openid profile",
  "automaticSilentRenew": true
}
```

**Important**: You should not manually edit this file as it's regenerated on each deployment. If authentication isn't working, redeploy the frontend to ensure you have the latest configuration.

### 5. Create a Cognito User

**If you provided `admin_user_email` in config:**

- Check your email for temporary password
- Sign in and change password on first login

**If you didn't provide email:**

1. Go to the [AWS Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
2. Find your User Pool (named `{stack_name_base}-user-pool`)
3. Click on the User Pool
4. Go to "Users" tab
5. Click "Create user"
6. Fill in the user details:
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Temporary password**: Create a temporary password
   - **Mark email as verified**: Check this box
7. Click "Create user"

### 5. Access the Application

1. Open the Amplify Hosting URL in your browser
1. Sign in with the Cognito user you created
1. You'll be prompted to change your temporary password on first login

## Post-Deployment

### Updating the Application

To update the frontend code:

```bash
# From root directory
./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
```

To update the backend agent:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
cdk deploy --all
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Create an ACM certificate in `us-east-1` region
2. Update `infra-cdk/config.yaml` with your domain and certificate ARN
3. Redeploy: `npm run build && npx cdk deploy --all`
4. Update your DNS to point to the CloudFront distribution

### Monitoring and Logs

- **Frontend logs**: Check CloudFront access logs
- **Backend logs**: Check CloudWatch logs for the AgentCore runtime
- **Build logs**: Check CodeBuild project logs for container builds

## Cleanup

To remove all resources:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
cdk destroy --force
```

**Warning**: This will delete all data including S3 buckets created during deployment and ECR images.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Architecture incompatible" or "exec format error" during Docker build**

   - This occurs when deploying from a non-ARM machine without cross-platform build setup
   - Follow the "Docker Cross-Platform Build Setup" instructions in the Prerequisites section
   - Ensure you've installed QEMU emulation: `docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all`
   - Verify ARM64 support: `docker buildx ls` should show `linux/arm64` in platforms

2. **"Agent Runtime ARN not configured"**

   - Ensure the backend stack deployed successfully
   - Check that SSM parameters were created correctly

3. **Authentication errors**

   - Verify you created a Cognito user
   - Check that the user's email is verified

4. **Build failures**

   - Check CodeBuild logs in the AWS Console
   - Ensure your agent code in `patterns/` is valid

5. **Permission errors**
   - Verify your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions
   - Check IAM roles created by the stack

### Getting Help

- Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
- Review the CDK deployment output for any warnings
- Ensure all prerequisites are met

## Security Considerations

- The Cognito User Pool is configured with strong password policies
- All communication uses HTTPS via CloudFront
- AgentCore runtime uses JWT authentication
- IAM roles follow least-privilege principles

For production deployments, consider:

- Enabling MFA on Cognito users
- Setting up custom domains with your own certificates
- Configuring additional monitoring and alerting
- Implementing backup strategies for any persistent data
