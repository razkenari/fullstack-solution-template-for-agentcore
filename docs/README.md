# FAST Documentation Site

This directory contains the MkDocs-based documentation site for the Fullstack AgentCore Solution Template (FAST). The site uses Material for MkDocs with dynamic navigation and is automatically deployed to GitLab Pages.

## Architecture Overview

The documentation system consists of four key components:

### 1. MkDocs Configuration (`mkdocs.yml`)

The site configuration defines the Material theme, plugins, and markdown extensions:

- **Theme**: Material for MkDocs with navigation features (tabs, sections, instant loading)
- **Plugins**: 
  - `search` - Full-text search across all documentation
  - `awesome-nav` - Dynamic navigation generation from directory structure
- **Extensions**: Code highlighting, admonitions, tables, Mermaid diagrams, and more

The configuration intentionally omits a `nav` section at the top level, delegating navigation structure to `.nav.yml` files within the `docs/` directory.

### 2. Dynamic Navigation (`.nav.yml`)

Navigation is managed through `.nav.yml` files placed in documentation directories. The `mkdocs-awesome-nav` plugin reads these files to build the navigation tree.

**Key Pattern**: `docs/docs/.nav.yml` uses glob patterns for automatic page discovery:

```yaml
nav:
  - Overview:
    - "*"
```

The `"*"` glob pattern matches all markdown files in the current directory, automatically adding them to the navigation without manual enumeration. This approach:

- Eliminates manual navigation maintenance
- Automatically includes new documentation files
- Preserves flexibility for custom ordering when needed

**Navigation Hierarchy**: The plugin supports nested `.nav.yml` files in subdirectories, allowing each section to manage its own navigation structure independently.

### 3. Build System (`Makefile`)

The Makefile provides standardized commands for documentation workflows:

- `make install` - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- `make docs` - Start local development server with live reload at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- `make build` - Build static site to `site/` directory
- `make gitlab-pages` - Build to `public/` directory (matches CI/CD behavior)
- `make clean` - Remove generated site files

The `gitlab-pages` target mirrors the CI/CD build process, enabling local verification before pushing changes.

### 4. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

Python packages required for building the documentation:

```
mkdocs                  # Core static site generator
mkdocs-material         # Material Design theme
mkdocs-awesome-nav      # Dynamic navigation from directory structure
mkdocstrings-python     # API documentation from Python docstrings (future use)
```

These dependencies are installed in both local development (`make install`) and CI/CD pipelines.

## GitLab Pages Deployment

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` includes a `pages` job that automatically deploys documentation:

**Trigger**: Runs on every merge to the default branch (main/master)

**Process**:
1. Install dependencies from `docs/requirements.txt`
2. Build MkDocs site to `public/` directory (GitLab Pages requirement)
3. Publish `public/` as artifacts for GitLab Pages

**URL**: Documentation is served at `https://<namespace>.gitlab.io/<project-name>/`

The job name must be exactly `pages` and artifacts must be in the `public/` directory for GitLab Pages to recognize and deploy the site.

## Local Development Workflow

### Initial Setup

```bash
cd docs
make install
```

### Writing Documentation

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   make docs
   ```

2. Edit markdown files in `docs/docs/` - changes appear instantly in browser

3. Add new files anywhere in `docs/docs/` - they automatically appear in navigation

### Testing CI Build Locally

```bash
make gitlab-pages
```

This builds the site to `public/` exactly as the CI pipeline does, allowing verification before pushing.

## Adding New Documentation

### Single Page

Create a markdown file in `docs/docs/`:

```bash
touch docs/docs/NEW_GUIDE.md
```

The file automatically appears in the "Overview" section due to the `"*"` glob pattern in `.nav.yml`.

### New Section

Create a subdirectory with its own `.nav.yml`:

```bash
mkdir docs/docs/advanced
touch docs/docs/advanced/.nav.yml
```

Define the section's navigation structure in `.nav.yml` using the same glob patterns or explicit file lists.

### Custom Ordering

Override automatic ordering by replacing the glob pattern with explicit file lists in `.nav.yml`:

```yaml
nav:
  - Overview:
    - README.md
    - DEPLOYMENT.md
    - AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md
```

## Technical Considerations

### Site URL Configuration

The `mkdocs.yml` intentionally omits `site_url` to avoid breaking Mermaid diagram rendering. A workaround script is included in `extra_javascript` to handle this limitation.

### Material Theme Features

Enabled features include:
- Code copy buttons
- Navigation tabs (top-level sections)
- Instant page loading
- Search highlighting
- Table of contents per page

### Markdown Extensions

The site supports:
- Admonitions (notes, warnings, tips)
- Code highlighting with language detection
- Tabbed content blocks
- Mermaid diagrams
- Tables with alignment
- Automatic table of contents generation

## Troubleshooting

**Navigation not updating**: Clear the `site/` directory with `make clean` and rebuild

**Mermaid diagrams not rendering**: Ensure `site_url` is not set in `mkdocs.yml`

**GitLab Pages not deploying**: Verify the job is named `pages` and artifacts are in `public/`

**Local server not reloading**: Check that files are in the `docs/docs/` directory, not `docs/`
